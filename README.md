Currently in development, Find Your New Fav is a software application intended to support up & coming musicians with their social media presence.

*From the product spec:*

__Problem:__
In the last few years, the music industry has changed drastically due to social media greatly expanding music consumption. This has caused many smaller artists/musicians to progressively lose the ability to reach a broadened audience. Resolving this issue would benefit independent artists, as well as the over saturation within the music industry.

__Summary__:
The final product will be a web application that allows up and coming musicians to reach a broader audience by recommending these “emerging” artists based on results from a machine learning model.
